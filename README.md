#### Issues:

**D3/Angular:**
We ran into an issue getting angular and d3 to use the same set of data to render the charts and dropdowns.  We installed the angular-nvd3 library to allow us to use a custom directive.  With nvd3 in place, we could write the d3 code in the angular controller to render the chart.

**Deploying to Heroku:**
Heroku was not able to install all our bower components, specifically the d3 and angular-nvd3 libraries.  We had to replace the script paths in our index page with URLs to their respective CDNs.

#### Technologies Used:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js, D3.js, Angular-nvD3.js, Bootstrap, Material Design Lite, Heroku, mLaB

#### Issues:

**Routing:**
We ran into issues passing data pulled from the google maps API from one page to the next page.  Initially we tried to write the data to the database, but eventually went with passing the variables in the URL.

**Styling:**
We didn't use a completely built out template to style our site so we had some difficulty positioning our navigation bar, logo, and footer exactly where we wanted.

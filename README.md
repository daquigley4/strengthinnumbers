#### Issues:

**D3/Angular:**
We ran into an issue getting angular and d3 to use the same set of players data to render the charts and dropdowns.  We installed angular-nvd3 to allow us 

**Styling:**
We didn't use a completely built out template to style our site so we had some difficulty positioning our navigation bar, logo, and footer exactly where we wanted.
